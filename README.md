# React navigation integration
 with Redux
This is my integration of react navigation with Redux.



Took inspiration from both this delightful projects:



* [Seedstars Labs React Native Mobile App Base Project (Frontend)](https://github.com/Seedstars/reactnative-mobile-app-base)


* [React Navigation ReduxExample](https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/tree/master/examples/ReduxExample)



## To improve


Currently, JS FPS drop really hard on TabNavigator.
